    Nanner of the day: The Possum
    I awoke from my slumber this morning and enjoyed a peaceful setting on the front porch with nature and coffee. Along came a possum and we shared a brief moment of eye contact and I came to a revelation. Nobody likes you, Possum. Even your furry friends in the animal kingdom frown upon you. You dig unsightly holes in our yards and feast upon rubbish and waste. But then I realized, the Possum isn't so bad. He's just livin his life tryin to get a lil grub, dig a few holes and maybe find a lil vermin mate and raise a family. You're alright in my book little buddy. Stay awesome, Possum.
    Enjoy the day,
    Adam Tingle
